# Back-end
This repository is a subsystem in a project for Software development (PBA) in Test and Database course.

This part is based on both database and test project which can be found here: [Test](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2018spring-test-teaching-material/blob/master/exercises/Final%20Assignment%202018.pdf) and [Database](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2018spring-databases-teaching-material/blob/master/assignments/Project%20Description.ipynb)

## Strategy and development
We have chosen to work as agile consultants in a 3 student team. We want to focus on high quality code which hopefully results in highly working software with low technical depth. We have chosen to develop in a mutated form of scrum using Waffle.io as a platform for this, in addition we have chosen to give the best attempt at test driven development / Acceptance testâ€“driven development. By creating tests first and using test as a documentation/design activity aswell as using the tests for regression testing. We have formulated a test strategy which can be found [Here](https://github.com/soft2018spring-gruppe10/Report/blob/master/Test%20Strategy.md)

## Development proccess of the API
- More into waffle.io and how we did scrum -> Into pearprogramming and reviewing each others code. How we made tests first and then procceded to implement.

## API
### Functionality:
- What it can do, and what routes it has, and what data it sends and so on.

### Overview
- Some architecture design and such.

### Low coupling
- Low coupling and high cohersion with interfaces and polymorphism, high quality code and low technical dept.

### Tests & Testcases
- References to tests and testcases.

### Continious Integration / Delivery / Deployment 
- How we did Continious integration and pipeline with tests and deployment and so on.
